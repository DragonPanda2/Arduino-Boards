Project Proposal for Project 2.

Our Project is to create an Emergency Mode on the Arduino Boards.
For this project, the following effects will be imposed on the classroom:
  -The blinds will lower
  -The lights will turn off
  -The audio will turn off
  -The projector screen will raise
  -The projector will turn off

For the blinds to lower:
  -If statement checking whether or not the blinds have not already been lowered. If they are already down, nothing will happen.
    -If the blinds are not down, the blinds will be lowered at X meters per second (X to be defined).
    -When the blinds reach their lowest point, they will stop (X = 0)

For the lights to turn off:
  -2 If statements:
    -If the front lights are off, do nothing, else:
      -Dim the front lights.
    -If the back lights are off, do nothing, else:
      -Dim the back lights.

For the audio to turn off:
  -If statement: If the audio is off, do nothing
    -If the audio is on, turn the audio off (volume = 0) and do NOT play any sound track ("Audio: ON")

For the projector screen to raise:
  -If statement: If the screen is already raised, do nothing, else:
    -Raise the screen at a rate of X meters per second (X to be defined).
    -When the screen reaches its apex, stop it from trying to raise any further (X = 0).

For the projector to turn off:
  -If statement: If the projector is already off, do nothing.
    -Else: Cut the power to the projector and do NOT play any sound track.
