Project Proposal for Project 2.

Our Project is to create an Emergency Mode on the Arduino Boards.
For this project, the following effects will be imposed on the classroom:
  -The blinds will lower
  -The lights will turn off
  -The audio will turn off
  -The projector screen will raise
  -The projector will turn off

For the blinds to lower:
  -If statement checking whether or not the blinds have not already been lowered. If they are already down, nothing will happen.
    -If the blinds are not down, the blinds will be lowered at X meters per second (X to be defined).
    -When the blinds reach their lowest point, they will stop (X = 0)
